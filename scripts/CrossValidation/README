DCA won't work with various threads when using held-out data. It is, if you se testdocs in .par file, you can only rain in one thread, likelihood stimation can still be done with various threads but training only in one, if you try to train with more than one thread, it is (e.g. -t 4) it will do it, but it will not use all threads and results will be weird, check the log to confirm this. When triaing on the entire corpus, multithreading works fine.
