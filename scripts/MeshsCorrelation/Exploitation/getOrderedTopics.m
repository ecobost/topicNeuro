% Returns the topics with highest probability p(m,z) for the given ID (MeshID, nodeID or treeNumber)
% Input:
%	matrix - data matrix (first column composed by indices, first row composed by topic numbers)
%	ID - the ID that is going ot be looked in the first row

function [topics, probs] = getOrderedTopics(matrix, ID)
	
	% Index in matrix of ID
	IDindex = find(matrix(:,1) == ID)(1);

	aux = matrix(IDindex, 2:end); % Probabilities
	aux = [aux; matrix(1, 2:end)]; % Topics
	aux = flipud(sortrows(aux')); % Order in ascending order based on the probs
	
	probs = aux(:,1);
	topics = aux(:,2);
